Changes
   * Update copyright notices to use Linux Foundation guidance. As a result,
     the copyright of contributors other than Arm is now acknowledged, and the
     years of publishing are no longer tracked in the source files. This also
     eliminates the need for the lines declaring the files to be part of
     MbedTLS. Fixes #3457.
